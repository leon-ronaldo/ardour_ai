User Profile and Preferences:

Profile Management: Allow users to create a profile picture, set a username, and potentially manage preferences for voice chat (language, accent) or notification styles.
Chat History Access: Provide an easy way for users to access past conversations with the chatbot, filtered by date, topic, or keyword. This allows them to revisit information or pick up where they left off.
Customization Options: Offer options to personalize the chat interface (themes, font size) or greetings to make the experience more user-friendly.
Task Management and Reminders:

Integrated To-Do List: Build upon the existing to-do list functionality by allowing users to set priorities, deadlines, and recurring tasks. This enhances organization and productivity.
Calendar Integration: Allow users to connect their calendar to the app so that tasks and reminders can be synced and displayed in one place. This reduces the risk of missed deadlines.
Habit Tracking: Implement a habit tracker where users can set goals, track progress, and receive motivational prompts from the chatbot.
Memory and Relationship Management:

Personal Timeline: Create a timeline of significant events (incidents) the user has shared, categorized by date or theme. This allows users to easily revisit past memories and experiences.
People Management: Develop a section where users can see a list of people they have spoken about with the chatbot, along with their relationships and any notable details (if shared). This helps users remember details about the people they have discussed.
Additional Features:

Sentiment Analysis: Integrate sentiment analysis to provide users with insights into their conversations with the chatbot. This could show the overall mood of their interactions and offer suggestions for self-improvement or positive reinforcement.
Goal Setting and Progress Tracking: Allow users to set personal goals and track their progress with the chatbot's help. This could involve breaking down goals into smaller tasks, offering encouragement, and providing feedback.
Mood Tracking and Emotional Support: If your chatbot can analyze user sentiment, consider offering a mood tracker and basic emotional support features. This could involve suggesting resources or activities based on the user's mood.
Remember: When adding features, prioritize user needs and maintain a clean, user-friendly interface. Consider using visual elements like progress bars, charts, or timelines to enhance user engagement.
